 The Augmented Humans (AHs) International Conference 2021 will be a hybrid online/physical conference, held on 22-24 February 2021. The physical conference will be held at the University of Lapland, Rovaniemi, Finland. The conference focuses on physical, cognitive, and perceptual augmentation of humans through digital technologies. The plural – humans – emphasizes the move towards technologies that enhance human capabilities beyond the individual and will have the potential for impact on societal scale.
 The idea of augmenting the human intellect has a long tradition, the term was coined by Douglas Engelbart in 1962 [1]. Today, many of the technologies envisioned by Engelbart and other are commonplace, and looking towards the future, many technologies which amplify the human body and mind far beyond the original vision are within reach.  The conference proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library as a volume in its International Conference Proceedings Series with ISBN (Pending).
